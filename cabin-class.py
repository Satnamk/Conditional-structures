# Write a program that asks the user to enter the cabin class of a cruise ship and then prints out a
# written description according to the list below. You must use an if/elif/else structure in your solution.

# LUX: upper-deck cabin with a balcony.
# A: above the car deck, equipped with a window.
# B: windowless cabin above the car deck.
# C: windowless cabin below the car deck.
# If the user enters an invalid cabin class, the program outputs an error message Invalid cabin class.

# Solution:

# Ask the user to enter the cabin class
cabin_class = input("Enter the cabin class (LUX, A, B, C): ")

# Print message as per cabin class
